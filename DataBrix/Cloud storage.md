## Cloud Storage:

### Data Storage ethodologies:

**1.    Object Storage:** Object storage is a data storage methodology where data instead of storing data in a hierarchical format it is stored flat using data object paths. A data object has a few key components

-   ID: Every data object has a unique ID that's part of  it's path.
-   Metadata: Metadata contains further information about the data like data type, owner info etc.
-   Attibutes: Attributes are similar to metadata in that they contain important information about the object essential for maintaining data integrity and security. Key attributes of a data object can be User priviledges, constraints etc.

**Advantages:** Data Objects ensure Scalability, Data Security, Replication and cost savings.
